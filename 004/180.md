# VotingEscrowTruf.sol#migrateVestingLock: does not recover user's unclaimed staking reword.

## Summary
`VotingEscrowTruf.sol#migrateVestingLock` function recovers user's points when the user lost his private key.
But it does not recover the user's unclaimed staking reword.

## Vulnerability Detail
`VotingEscrowTruf.sol#migrateVestingLock` function is following.
```solidity
    function migrateVestingLock(address oldUser, address newUser, uint256 lockupId)
        external
        onlyVesting
        returns (uint256 newLockupId)
    {
        if (oldUser == newUser) {
            revert NotMigrate();
        }
        if (newUser == address(0)) {
            revert ZeroAddress();
        }
        Lockup memory oldLockup = lockups[oldUser][lockupId];
        if (!oldLockup.isVesting) {
            revert NoAccess();
        }

        uint256 points = oldLockup.points;
        stakingRewards.withdraw(oldUser, points);
        _burn(oldUser, points);

        newLockupId = lockups[newUser].length;
        lockups[newUser].push(oldLockup);
246:    _mint(newUser, points);
247:    stakingRewards.stake(newUser, points);

        delete lockups[oldUser][lockupId];

        emit Migrated(oldUser, newUser, lockupId, newLockupId);
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function recovers the users lost `points` in `L246` `L247`.
But it does not recover the reward that the user has not previously claimed.

## Impact
The user will lose his unclaimed reward from `stakingRewards`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify `migrateVestingLock` function to  the reward that the user has not previously claimed.
To do that, Add the following function to `VirtualStakingRewards.sol`.
```solidity
    function getRewardTo(address user, address to) public updateReward(user) onlyOperator returns (uint256 reward) {
        reward = rewards[user];
        if (reward != 0) {
            rewards[user] = 0;
            IERC20(rewardsToken).safeTransfer(to, reward);
            emit RewardPaid(to, reward);
        }
    }
```
Next, add the following line to `migrateVestingLock` function.
```solidity
248:    stakingRewards.getRewardTo(oldUser, newUser);
```
